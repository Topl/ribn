# As a Reviewer or Author

## DO: Assume competence. 

An author’s implementation or a reviewer’s recommendation may be due to the other party having different context than you. Start by asking questions to gain understanding.

## DO: Provide rationale or context

Such as a best practices document, a style guide, or a design document. This can help others understand your decision or provide mentorship. 

## DO: Consider how comments may be interpreted. 

Be mindful of the differing ways hyperbole, jokes, and emojis may be perceived. 

e.g.:

Authors Don’t | Authors Do
--- | ---
I prefer short names so I’d rather not change this. Unless you make me? :) | Best practice suggests omitting obvious/generic terms. I’m not sure how to reconcile that advice with this request.

## DON’T: Criticize the person. 

Instead, discuss the code. Even the perception that a comment is about a person (e.g., due to using “you” or “your”) distracts from the goal of improving the code. 

e.g.:

Reviewers Don’t | Reviewers Do
--- | ---
Why are you using this approach? You’re adding unnecessary complexity. | This concurrency model appears to be adding complexity to the system without any visible performance benefit.

## DON’T: Use harsh language. 

Code review comments with a negative tone are less likely to be useful. For example, prior research found very negative comments were considered useful by authors 57% of the time, while more-neutral comments were useful 79% of the time.  

# As a Reviewer

## DO: Provide specific and actionable feedback.

If you don’t have specific advice, sometimes it’s helpful to ask for clarification on why the author made a decision. 

e.g.:

Reviewers Don’t | Reviewers Do
--- | ---
I don’t understand this. | If this is an optimization, can you please add comments?


## DO: Clearly mark nitpicks and optional comments.

By using prefixes such as ‘Nit’ or ‘Optional’. This allows the author to better gauge the reviewer’s expectations.

# As an Author

## DO: Clarify code or reply to the reviewer’s comment.

In response to feedback, failing to do so can signal a lack of receptiveness to implementing improvements to the code. 

e.g.

Authors Don’t | Authors Do
--- | ---
That makes sense in some cases butnot here. | I added a comment about why it’s implemented that way.

## DO: When disagreeing with feedback, explain the advantage of your approach. 

In cases where you can’t reach consensus, bring the discussion on Slack with other peers from the team.
